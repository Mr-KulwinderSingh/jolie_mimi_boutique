The emphasis is on the user experience; the user can navigate the website easily to fulfill users' goals. The website is designed to be easy to use and easy to understand. Additionally, the website attracts customers to become a part of loyalty programs by giving them additional discounts on their purchases.
It also handles all personnel functionality moving from admin to manager to logistics to other personnel.
Business goals were to make the website as scalable as possible and reusable in the real world so that the store personnel could use it according to their position in the company.

### Wireframes

All wireframes can be found via this link to the GitHub folder [here](https://github.com/Mr-KulwinderSingh/jolie_mimi_boutique/tree/main/readme-images/wireframes)

### Fonts

- **Logo:** 
- **Logo:** 
**[Nunito](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito?query=Nunito):** Nunito is an impactful display font that adds a rebellious vibe to an e-commerce platform. With its simple & clear appearance, Nunito commands smoothness and makes a clear statement, perfect for conveying a sense of activism or boldness in the design. Its distinct letterforms and unique style give to the project a standout aesthetic, while still maintaining legibility for titles and description.

**[Jaini](https://fonts.google.com/?preview.text=Jolie-Mimi-Boutique&query=Jaini):** Jaini is a font that can suit any type of logo, but its unique and mixed italic style makes the name Jolie Mimi Boutique look more elegant and clear, adding to its sophistication. 
Both Protest Strike and Dancing Script were used for my logo - they excellently contrast each other. 

**[Sans-serif]** Choosing sans-serif as the backup ensures universal legibility,especially on screens and digital platforms. Sans-serif fonts are known for their clarity and readability, making them a reliable fallback option in case any issues arise with the primary or secondary font choices. I also used cursive as the backup font for Dancing Script in the logo. 



### Colors

<div align="center">

</div>

In crafting the color palette for this project, I aimed to strike a perfect balance between vibrancy, clarity, and visual appeal. Let's delve into why each color was carefully chosen:

- **Off Pink (#e12656) for the Logo**: Off Pink, kind a fushia colour is a bit unique and girlish colour which suits the best for our ladies' fashion boutique, being a classic and glossy look provides a strong combination of our logo and the delivery banner and follow the line down to shop now button. Its timeless appeal ensures that our brand identity stands out boldly against lighter backgrounds, guaranteeing excellent readability and visibility. Plus, base pink exudes professionalism and sophistication, aligning perfectly with our brand's ethos.
    
- **White (#FFFFFF) for the Background**: White serves as the canvas upon which all other colors and content come to life. Its clean and neutral nature creates a sense of spaciousness and cleanliness, enhancing readability and user experience. A white background exudes simplicity and elegance, perfectly complementing various design styles.
    
- **Yellow (#ffc107) for Buttons, messages background**: #ffc107 is a darker shade of yellow. It carries a rich and deep tone that exudes sophistication and depth. This color combines the vibrancy of yellow with the calming qualities, resulting in a hue that is both bold and grounded.
    

In essence, our color palette embodies simplicity and vibrancy, creating a visually appealing and user-friendly experience. The combination of classic pink, pristine white, and lively yellow forms a cohesive design that effectively communicates our brand's message. This palette also allows our vibrant product and brand name to shine, creating a dynamic and engaging platform for our audience.

## Agile Development

The journey of Jolie Mimi Boutique began with the establishment of a GitHub Projects Page, serving as the central hub for project management. This platform played a pivotal role in organizing tasks systematically, creating user stories, and breaking them down into actionable steps. The overarching goal was to create a structured roadmap that would guide the project towards successful completion within the designated timeframe. Utilizing the GitHub Projects Page enabled the tracking of the project's evolution, assignment of tasks, and achievement of milestones, ensuring a smooth and organized development process. The MoSCoW method, alongside customized GitHub project labels, was instrumental in assisting me in prioritizing essential tasks within the constraints of my available time.
