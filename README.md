The emphasis is on the user experience; the user can navigate the website easily to fulfill users' goals. The website is designed to be easy to use and easy to understand. Additionally, the website attracts customers to become a part of loyalty programs by giving them additional discounts on their purchases.

Business goals were to make the website as scalable as possible and reusable in the real world so that the store personnel could use it according to their position in the company.

## Visual Design
### Wireframes

All wireframes can be found via this link to the GitHub folder [here](https://github.com/leec313/Fetch-and-Feast/blob/main/readme-images/wireframes)

### Fonts

- **Logo:** 
**[Protest Strike Font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Protest+Strike):** Protest Strike is a bold and impactful display font that adds a rebellious and edgy vibe to your project. With its strong, stencil-like appearance, Protest Strike commands attention and makes a statement, perfect for conveying a sense of activism or boldness in your design. Its distinct letterforms and unique style give your project a standout aesthetic, while still maintaining legibility for titles and headings.
**[Dancing Script Font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Dancing+Script):** Dancing Script is a playful and elegant script font that brings a touch of whimsy and sophistication to your project. With its flowing, cursive letterforms and graceful strokes, Dancing Script adds a sense of charm and personality to your design, making it ideal for conveying a sense of warmth and friendliness.
Both Protest Strike and Dancing Script were used for my logo - they excellently contrast each other. 
- **Clean Aesthetic: [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato)** (used for the rest of my site) is a sans-serif font with a clean and modern aesthetic, making it suitable for a wide range of design applications. Its simplicity and readability contribute to a professional and polished look for the project.
- **Universal Legibility:** Choosing sans-serif as the backup ensures universal legibility, especially on screens and digital platforms. Sans-serif fonts are known for their clarity and readability, making them a reliable fallback option in case any issues arise with the primary or secondary font choices. I also used cursive as the backup font for Dancing Script in the logo. 


### Colors

</div>

In crafting the color palette for this project, I aimed to strike a perfect balance between vibrancy, clarity, and visual appeal. Let's delve into why each color was carefully chosen:

- **Black (#000000) for the Logo**: Black, being classic and versatile, provides a strong foundation for our logo. Its timeless appeal ensures that our brand identity stands out boldly against lighter backgrounds, guaranteeing excellent readability and visibility. Plus, black exudes professionalism and sophistication, aligning perfectly with our brand's ethos.
    
- **White (#FFFFFF) for the Background**: White serves as the canvas upon which all other colors and content come to life. Its clean and neutral nature creates a sense of spaciousness and cleanliness, enhancing readability and user experience. A white background exudes simplicity and elegance, perfectly complementing various design styles.
    
- **Dark Green (#0a8362) for Buttons, Links, Headers, and Icons**: #0a8362 is a darker shade of teal-green. It carries a rich and deep tone that exudes sophistication and depth. This color combines the vibrancy of green with the calming qualities of teal, resulting in a hue that is both bold and grounded.
    
- **Red (#DC3545) for Errors and Delete Buttons**: Red, particularly #DC3545, serves as a signal for alerts, warnings, or errors. Its darker hue maintains visibility while conveying a sense of urgency or caution. By using this color for error messages and delete buttons, we ensure that users take notice and proceed with care when necessary.
    

In essence, our color palette embodies simplicity and vibrancy, creating a visually appealing and user-friendly experience. The combination of classic black, pristine white, lively teal/green, and alerting red forms a cohesive design that effectively communicates our brand's message. This palette also allows our vibrant product and blog imagery to shine, creating a dynamic and engaging platform for our audience.

## Agile Development

The journey of Fetch & Feast began with the establishment of a GitHub Projects Page, serving as the central hub for project management. This platform played a pivotal role in organizing tasks systematically, creating user stories, and breaking them down into actionable steps. The overarching goal was to create a structured roadmap that would guide the project towards successful completion within the designated timeframe. Utilizing the GitHub Projects Page enabled the tracking of the project's evolution, assignment of tasks, and achievement of milestones, ensuring a smooth and organized development process. The MoSCoW method, alongside customized GitHub project labels, was instrumental in assisting me in prioritizing essential tasks within the constraints of my available time.

### Project Milestones

The project was divided into several key milestones, each representing a significant phase in the development process. Within each milestone, epics were identified, representing broader themes or features to be implemented. These epics were further broken down into user stories, representing specific functionalities or requirements from the user's perspective. Finally, tasks were defined within each user story, representing the individual steps needed to fulfill the user story's objectives.

### Project Progression

The project evolved iteratively, with each milestone representing a significant step forward in the development process. Tasks within each milestone were completed incrementally, with regular reviews and adjustments made to ensure alignment with project goals and user requirements. As tasks were completed, they were moved across the Kanban board, providing a clear visual representation of progress and remaining work.

In summary, the use of project milestones, epics, user stories, and tasks, coupled with effective project management tools like GitHub Projects and Kanban boards, facilitated a structured and organized approach to building Fetch & Feast.
